# Climate Change: Causes, Effects, and Solutions

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather
patterns. While some climate change is natural, since the mid-20th century
human activities have been the main driver of climate change.

## Causes of Climate Change
The primary cause of modern climate change is the increase of greenhouse
gases in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most significant,
released through burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas.
Deforestation also contributes because trees absorb CO2.

Methane (CH4), another potent greenhouse gas, is emitted during the
production and transport of coal, oil, and natural gas, as well as from
livestock and agricultural practices. Nitrous oxide (N2O) comes from
agricultural and industrial activities.

The greenhouse effect works by trapping heat from the sun in Earth's
atmosphere. Without any greenhouse effect, Earth would be too cold to
support life. However, the enhanced greenhouse effect caused by excess
emissions is warming the planet at an alarming rate.

## Effects of Climate Change
Global average temperatures have risen by approximately 1.1 degrees Celsius
since pre-industrial times. This warming has widespread effects:

Rising sea levels threaten coastal communities worldwide. The melting of
polar ice caps and glaciers contributes to sea level rise, which could
displace hundreds of millions of people living in low-lying areas.

Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and intense. Hurricanes,
droughts, wildfires, and floods are all intensified by a warmer climate.
The 2019-2020 Australian bushfire season and recent flooding events in
Europe and Asia are linked to climate change.

Biodiversity loss is accelerating as species struggle to adapt to rapidly
changing conditions. Coral reefs, which support about 25% of all marine
species, are at severe risk from ocean warming and acidification.

## Solutions
Transitioning to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and
hydroelectric power is the most important step. The cost of solar panels
has dropped by over 90% in the last decade, making clean energy increasingly
competitive with fossil fuels.

Energy efficiency improvements in buildings, transportation, and industry
can significantly reduce emissions. Electric vehicles (EVs) are replacing
internal combustion engine cars at a growing pace.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies aim to remove CO2 directly
from the atmosphere or capture it at emission sources. Reforestation and
protecting existing forests are natural carbon sinks.

International cooperation is essential. The Paris Agreement, signed in 2015,
committed nations to limiting warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above
pre-industrial levels, with efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
