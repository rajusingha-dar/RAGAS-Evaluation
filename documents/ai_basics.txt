# Artificial Intelligence Basics

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence
processes by computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning,
and self-correction.

## Machine Learning
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn
and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses
on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn
for themselves.

There are three main types of machine learning:
- Supervised Learning: The algorithm is trained on labeled data. For example,
  training a model to classify emails as spam or not spam using historical
  labeled emails.
- Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm finds patterns in unlabeled data.
  Clustering customers into segments based on purchasing behavior is a
  common example.
- Reinforcement Learning: An agent learns to make decisions by receiving
  rewards or penalties. This is how AlphaGo learned to play board games
  at superhuman level.

## Deep Learning
Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks
with many layers (hence "deep") to model complex patterns in data. It
has revolutionized fields like image recognition, speech recognition,
and natural language processing.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used for image tasks,
while Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers are dominant
in language tasks.

## Natural Language Processing
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI focused on enabling
computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Key tasks
include sentiment analysis, machine translation, named entity recognition,
and question answering.

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 are transformer-based models
trained on vast amounts of text data. They can generate coherent text,
answer questions, write code, and summarize documents.

## AI Ethics
As AI becomes more pervasive, ethical considerations have grown in importance.
Key concerns include algorithmic bias, where models reflect biases present
in training data, privacy issues around data collection, lack of transparency
in decision-making (the "black box" problem), and potential job displacement
due to automation.

Responsible AI development involves fairness, accountability, transparency,
and safety. Organizations like Anthropic, DeepMind, and OpenAI publish
safety research to address these challenges.
